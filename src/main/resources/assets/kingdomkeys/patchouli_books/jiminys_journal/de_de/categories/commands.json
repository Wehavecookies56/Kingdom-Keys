This is your Kingdom Keys $(thing)Command Menu.$() Navigating this menu is as simple as using your Arrow Keys. Up and Down navigates the menu, Right selects and confirms, Left cancels your selection. $(thing)Attack$() is naturally bound to your regular Minecraft attack and mine button, so we can skip over that one.",
