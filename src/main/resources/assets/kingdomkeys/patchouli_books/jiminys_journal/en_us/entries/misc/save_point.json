Save Points come in three versions: Normal Save Points, $(#0F0)Linked Save Points$(), and $(#00F)Warp Points$(), where each of them is an upgrade version of the previous one. Normal ones just have two floating green trails, a Linked one has a round plate beneath it, and a Warp Point is the same as a Linked Save Point, but with a blue tint."

For that, the reaction command has to be used that appears once you stand ontop of a Save Point. If it happens to be a Linked or Warp Save Point, then you might also be prompted to give it a name. (Note that the current view will serve as the preview image to this save.) If you have more than one Linked or Warped save added, you can teleport between them. Linked Saves can teleport to any of your save points within the same dimension, where Warped ones can additionally teleport you to Other Warp Points of other Dimensions."
