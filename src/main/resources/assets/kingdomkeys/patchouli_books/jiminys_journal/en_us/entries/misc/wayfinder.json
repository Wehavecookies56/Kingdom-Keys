With this you can give your own crafted Wayfinder to another player, which they can use to $(thing)teleport$() to you at any time, as long as $(thing)both are online$() and in the $(thing)same party$(). However, due to it's pretty strong feature, it has a $(thing)long cooldown$() and requires you to reach $(lissa)the End$()."
