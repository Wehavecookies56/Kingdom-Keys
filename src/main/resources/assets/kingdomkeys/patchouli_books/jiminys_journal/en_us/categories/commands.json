This is your Kingdom Keys $(thing)Command Menu.$() Navigating this menu is as simple as using your Arrow Keys. $(thing)[$(k:key.kingdomkeys.scrollup)]$() and $(thing)[$(k:key.kingdomkeys.scrolldown)]$() navigates the menu, $(thing)[$(k:key.kingdomkeys.enter)]$() selects and confirms, $(thing)[$(k:key.kingdomkeys.back)]$() cancels your selection. Alternatively you can also use $(thing)[$(k:key.kingdomkeys.scrollactivator)]$() and your Scrollwheel. $(lissa)Attack$() works like in regular Minecraft, so we can $(lissa)skip over that one$().",
